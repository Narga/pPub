Installation:
-For archlinux: Install ppub from AUR.

Manual Installation:
-ppub.py should go in /usr/bin/
-night.css, COPYING and README should go in /usr/share/ppub/
-Icons from misc/ should go to /usr/share/icons/hicolor/<size>/apps
-/misc/ppub.desktop should go to /usr/share/applications
If you create a package for another distro, please send me a mail so I can mention it here.
A setup.py will be created soon to make installation easier.

Configuration file(~/.ppub.conf):
-cachedir = Path to cache (default /tmp/ppub-cache-username/). Keep trailing /.
-usercss = Path to user CSS. If it's set to 'None' or something that's not a path, User CSS will be disabled.
Note: Values outside the [Main] group should not be changed.

How to contribute:
-Night mode's CSS is not perfect and many books could have themed elements that this CSS doesn't cover. You can help by sending the .css file inside that book, so I can add more elements to night.css
-In case you have a book that is not working, please extract your epub file like a zip and send me any .opf and .ncx files it has inside. I will do my best to fix the problem then :).
-Of course, feel free to fork this repository and add any features you want. You can mail me requests too.
